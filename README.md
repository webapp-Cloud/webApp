# webApp

This README provides instructions for setting up, building, and deploying the application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
2. Maven 3.6 or later
3. Git
4. Your favorite IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Spring Tool Suite recommended)

## Forking the Repository

1. Go to the original GitHub repository: `https://github.com/webapp-Cloud/webApp.git`
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork

## Building and Deploying Locally

### Clone your forked repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-app.git
cd spring-boot-app
```

### Build the application

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will download all dependencies, compile the code, run tests, and package the application.

### Run the application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your commit message here"
   ```

3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository when you're ready to merge your changes.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with your specific configuration if needed.
- If you're using an IDE, you can import the project as a Maven project and run it from there.
- For any additional dependencies or plugins, update the `pom.xml` file accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or deployment, please check the following:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed and configured.
2. Verify that you're using compatible versions of Java and Maven.
3. Check the application logs for any error messages.
